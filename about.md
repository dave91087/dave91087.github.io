## Who Am I?

I'm Dave, and I'm a senior Java developer currently working at [Kobalt Music](http://www.kobaltmusic.com). That was boring, wasn't it.

 + I love programming.

 + I love problem solving.

 + I have a tortuous, but ultimately satisfying relationship with oracle databases.

 + I can, and will, watch almost any sport on the planet but Rugby is my one true love.

## n.b.

This website is an experiment on my part. I hope to use it to put up posts about my various interests, and to document any open source work I do. Please be aware that I am in no way a web developer, and this is my first experience of using Jekyll, Ruby and GitHub pages.
